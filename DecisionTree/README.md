# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Decision--Tree-Classifier
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment and survival. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that can detect breast cancer from medical images with high accuracy. In this report, we present a project that aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques.

The project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The program was trained and tested on a cleaned and balanced dataset from Kaggle called “Breast Cancer Wisconsin”. A decision tree classifier was used to achieve an accuracy of 0.9385964912280702. The dataset was cleaned and balanced by the author before training the model. The decision tree classifier was chosen due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in binary classification problems. The program takes in various features of a patient’s breast mass such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. These features were used to train the decision tree model and predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The program achieved a precision of 0.9487179487179487, recall of 0.8809523809523809 and F1 Score of 0.9135802469135802 in detecting breast cancer.
